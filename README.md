# Procedural cave generation with cellular automata

## Intro :
[Here](https://youtu.be/OK84BGDionw) is a clip of this program in action.

This is a program to procedurally generate cave systems with cellular automata<br/>
This program is written in [LuaJIT](https://luajit.org/luajit.html) and runs on [LÖVE](https://love2d.org)<br/>

## Controls :
* Click at the left side of the screen or press **n** to generate a new cave
* Click at the right side of the screen or press **s** to apply the cellular automata rules on the cave

## Information :
I learnt the process from [this tutorial](https://gamedevelopment.tutsplus.com/tutorials/generate-random-cave-levels-using-cellular-automata--gamedev-9664)<br/>
